    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# Math Iterators

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Math iterators.



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import ns from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-iter@deno/mod.js';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the deno branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/math-iter/tags). For example,

```javascript
import ns from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-iter@v0.1.0-deno/mod.js';
```

You can also import the following named exports from the package:

```javascript
import { ops, sequences, special, tools, utils } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-iter@deno/mod.js';
```

#### ns

Namespace containing math iterators.

```javascript
var iterators = ns;
// returns {...}
```

The namespace contains the following sub-namespaces:

<!-- <toc pattern="*"> -->

<div class="namespace-toc">

-   <span class="signature">[`ops`][@stdlib/math/iter/ops]</span><span class="delimiter">: </span><span class="description">math operator iterators.</span>
-   <span class="signature">[`sequences`][@stdlib/math/iter/sequences]</span><span class="delimiter">: </span><span class="description">math iterators for generating sequences.</span>
-   <span class="signature">[`special`][@stdlib/math/iter/special]</span><span class="delimiter">: </span><span class="description">math iterators for special functions.</span>
-   <span class="signature">[`tools`][@stdlib/math/iter/tools]</span><span class="delimiter">: </span><span class="description">math iterator tools.</span>
-   <span class="signature">[`utils`][@stdlib/math/iter/utils]</span><span class="delimiter">: </span><span class="description">math utility iterators.</span>
